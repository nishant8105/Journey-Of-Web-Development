## Day 12 of learning Web development

Today I have learn about who to use font , color and type of Color to use

- The hex code consists of a hash(#) symbol followed by six characters. These six characters are arranged into a set of three pairs (RR, GG, and BB).
- RGB stands for “Red, Green, Blue,” and it defines the colour value by taking three (red, green, blue) arguments.Each argument value lies between 0 and 255.
- Similar to RGB, in RGBA, a stands for alpha value, which defines the opacity of the color. The alpha value lies between 0 and 1.
- HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness.
<ol><li> Hue(h): 
<ul> <li>Hue represents the type of color. It is measured in degrees, and its value lies from 0 to 360.
 <li> 0 degree represents black, 120 degree is for green, and 360 degree is for blue.</ul>
<li> Saturation(S):
<ul> <li>Saturation controls the intensity or purity of the color. It is measured in percentage, and its value lies between 0% and 100%.
<li>0% saturation is no color (grayscale), and 100% saturation is the most intense colour.</ul>
<li> Lightness(L):
<ul> <li> Lightness determines how light or dark the colour is. It is measured in percentage, and its value lies between 0% and 100%.
<li> 0% lightness represents pure black, 50% lightness represents normal colour, and 100% lightness is pure white. </ol>

### The work planned for today has been completed. We’ll continue tomorrow.
