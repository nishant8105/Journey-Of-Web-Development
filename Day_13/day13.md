CSS stand for Cascading stylesheet. The Cascade algorithm is followedUnderstanding the cascade algorithm helps you understand how the browser resolves conflicts like this. The cascade algorithm has 4 distinct stages.

- Position and order of appearance: the order in which your CSS rules appear
- Specificity: an algorithm that determines which CSS selector has the strongest match **(inline > ID > class > element > universal)**
- Origin: the order in which CSS appears and where it comes from, whether that is a browser style, CSS from a browser extension, or your authored CSS
- Importance: some CSS rules are weighted more heavily than others, especially with the **!important** rule type
